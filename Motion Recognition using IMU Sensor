This project involves building a real-time motion classification system using a Raspberry Pi and the Sense HAT. It uses accelerometer and gyroscope data to detect four motion types and displays the results through the LED matrix.

Overview
The system recognizes the following motion gestures:

move_none
move_circle
move_shake
move_twist
A neural network model is trained on 1-second sequences (50 time steps, 6 features: accel + gyro) and then converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on Raspberry Pi.
